Most bikes are rented and returned in the Manhattan city center than other areas, this is likely due to the higher population density in this area of the city.

The last visualization looks at peak hours in August. It can be seen that the least popular hours to ride are between 1A and 5A, this may be a good time to service bikes.

## Summary
From reviewing the data it can be summarized that male users that subscribe to the ride sharing app are the biggest demographic that utilizes the ride sharing program. It can be determined that the city center is a popular area to place bikes, as it is close to many businesses and a high population density. With the average ride being about 5 minutes the radius does not have to be very large. In Des Moines the radius may need to be a little larger, as the population may not be as dense in the city center. Bikes are also used the most before and after work, with also supports the idea that bikes should be placed close to the city center near popular businesses. A few additional visualizations could be added to this analysis as well. The first one being a visualization looking at user age by gender. This could also be useful in deciding if this could be a popular program in the Des Moines area based on their demographics as well as give an insight of the best way to market in the new city. Another visualization that could be looked at is the top starting points based on usertype. This could be important in looking at the areas that are most popular for subscribers to continue client satisfaction, but also areas to target for marketing towards users that are not subscribers, but use the bikes often.
